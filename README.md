#Techdegree project #8

You've been tasked with creating an application for your local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data in manually. The librarian wants a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

In this project, you'll build a web application that'll include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. You'll be given HTML designs and an existing SQLite database. You'll be required to implement a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
